\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

The introduction should provide a clear overview of the research topic, the motivation for the study, the research objectives and considered questions. Central assumptions and limitations of the study should be outlined. 

Often the introduction also includes a paragraph on the structure of the thesis. This is only optional and depends on the individual preferences of the author. However, as such a manuscript structure overview is mostly redundant to the information provided in the table of content, it is recommended to refrain from providing a structure overview for the sake of brevity.
