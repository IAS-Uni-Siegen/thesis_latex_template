\begin{abstract}
The abstract is a concise summary that provides a brief overview of the study's background, key objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. It serves as a standalone representation of the research, allowing readers to quickly grasp the essential aspects of the study without having to read the entire document. In a thesis work, the abstract should not be longer than one page. 

Sometimes, the abstract is wrongly used as only a preface or introduction. However, the abstract is not meant to provide only introductory information, but should present itself as a self-contained summary of the entire work.
