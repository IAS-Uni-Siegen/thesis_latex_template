\chapter{Conclusion} 
\label{cha:conclusion}

The main insights of this investigation are...
\begin{tbox}{Conclusion vs. summary}
In the final chapter of the manuscript, the author should provide a conclusion of the work. However, in practice many authors formulate a summary instead of a genuine conclusion. Hence, please note the differences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Is meant to provide a final interpretation of the study's results and offer insights into the broader implications of the findings. It often discusses the significance of the research in the context of existing knowledge. In simple words: what are the take-home insights of the work?
    \item \textbf{Summary:} Aims to consecutively recap all key points of the entire work. It covers a step-by-step overview of the main objectives, utilized assumptions, applied methods, empirical experiments and the found results. The summary therefore goes beyond the conclusion, as it focus not the findings, but provides a larger overview of the entire work.
\end{itemize} 
In this template, the manuscript already starts with an abstract which is a very concise and brief summary. Therefore, the final conclusion within this chapter should be a true conclusion and not a second, redundant summary.   
\end{tbox}
Another hint: to ensure that the conclusion is concise and to the point, one can consider using a bullet point list and avoid long, complex sentences. This will help the reader to extract the main insights quickly.


\section{Future work}
\label{sec:futurework}
The outlook of this work should provide a brief overview of potential future research directions. This can include open questions, unsolved problems, or potential improvements of the current work. It is also possible to discuss potential applications of the findings in practice. A bullet point list is again a good choice for this section to ensure a clear and concise presentation of the future work.
